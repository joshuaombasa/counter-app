NBA COUNTER APP.


NBA COUNTER APP THAT UPDATES SCORES (three point plays, free throws, jumpers/postups).


Built using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.

This JavaScript code sets up event listeners for three buttons, increase, decrease, and reset.
When the "increase" button is clicked, the count is incremented by 1.
When the "decrease" button is clicked, the count is decremented by 1. 
When the "reset" button is clicked, the count is reset back to 0. 

The value of the count is displayed on the page by updating the text content of the element with an ID of "value".
This JavaScript code is a simple implementation of a counter that increments, decrements, and resets the count value. It uses the DOM API to manipulate the HTML elements on the page.
